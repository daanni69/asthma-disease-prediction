## Asthma Prediction using Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

This project aims to predict asthma risk based on patient attributes using machine learning. The focus is on data cleaning, preprocessing, feature selection (via correlation), and model training using a Logistic Regression.

## ðŸš€ Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Plotly
- GitHub

## ðŸ§  Steps Covered
1. Data Cleaning & Missing Value Imputation
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Encoding
4. Correlation Analysis
5. Feature Selection
6. Model Training & Evaluation (RandomForest)
7. Model Saving with Pickle

## ðŸ“ˆ Model Accuracy
- **Accuracy**: 96.6%
- **Precision/Recall (Class 1)**: 0.97 / 0.89

## ðŸ“· Visuals
Find visualizations in the `plots/` folder:
- Heatmap
- Correlation Matrix
- Distribution plots

## ðŸ“¦ How to Use
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the notebook `asthma_prediction.ipynb`
3. Run all cells to see the full pipeline
4. Trained model saved as `asthma_model.pkl`

## ðŸ“‚ Output
Model file: `asthma_model.pkl`
